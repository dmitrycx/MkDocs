# Request Approval Process

Depending on your configuration, user-submitted requests may require approval before they are applied to the schedule.

---

## Auto-Approval (Default for Free Edition)

In most Free Edition environments:

- Requests are **automatically approved** upon submission.
- No manual review is required by schedulers.

---

## Manual Approval Workflow

If manual approval is enabled:

- Requests enter a `Pending` state.
- Schedulers can approve or deny each request manually.
