# Request Deadlines and Reminders

Each scheduling period in Intrigma defines a **request window** during which users may submit their work or time off preferences.

---

## Key Dates

- **Request Start Date** – When users are allowed to begin submitting requests.
- **Request Deadline** – The final day requests can be submitted for consideration.

These dates are configured per scheduling period and are critical for managing timely submissions.

---

## Late Requests

Requests submitted **after the deadline** may:

- Be automatically denied
- Be excluded from automation consideration
- Require manual approval (if applicable)
